# PISCOt_v1-2_raw_observed_dataset

This repo contains the scripts that merge all the observed datasets from manned climatological stations (Peru - [SENAMHI](https://www.senamhi.gob.pe); Bolivia, Chile - [Explorador Climatico](http://explorador.cr2.cl/); Ecuador, Colombia - Cooperation projects). The final dataset is used as a raw observed dataset for the development of [PISCOt v1.2](https://github.com/adrHuerta/PISCOt_v1-2), those files follow the [rclimdex format](http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/RClimDex/RClimDexUserManual.doc) (this was chosen because SENAMHI used it frequently and for many other climate-related scripts).

The dataset is upon request (as seen in _# Heavy dirs_ in [.gitignore](https://github.com/adrHuerta/PISCOt_v1-2_raw_observed_dataset/blob/main/.gitignore)) and can be accessed from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HXov_mwaw-J6LywCYKGQuQdSGBrr9x64?usp=sharing) (private link).
